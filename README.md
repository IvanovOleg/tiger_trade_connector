# tiger-trade-connector
(Under developoment...)

A cross-platform middleware that connects (tiger.trade terminal)[https://www.tiger.trade/terminal] to various data sources and brokers.

This tool can mimic the [Trader Workstation](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) API in order to simplify connectivity from the [tiger.trade](https://www.tiger.trade) terminal, but gets data from one of supported market data feeds and process orders through one of supported brokers.

## Supported Market Data Feeds
* [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/)

## Supported Brokers
* [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets/)
